I"¡<p>Toshiba released these two netbooks over 10 years ago with one special characteristic: a â€œtransflectiveâ€ display, a combination of a normal transmissive LCD and a reflective LCD. Thereâ€™s a button right above the keyboard to turn the backlight completely off, and with a strong enough light in front (or direct sunlight) it can be used in full reflective mode. Theyâ€™re usually sold for very cheap (&lt;$150) and work reasonably well but are definitely on the slow side by todayâ€™s comparisons. Iâ€™m using the Portege R500 to create this website and itâ€™s been indispensable. One of only a couple options if you need color, but theyâ€™re very hard to find.</p>
