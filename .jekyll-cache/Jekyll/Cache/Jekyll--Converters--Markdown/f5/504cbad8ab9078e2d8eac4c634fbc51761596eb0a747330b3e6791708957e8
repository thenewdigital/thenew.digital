I"Â<p><a href="http://dasungtech.com/">Dasung</a> is a Chinese company that makes HDMI-compatible E Ink computer monitors, and their latest models are fast enough to watch videos. Their Paperlike HD 2019 was the monitor that changed my life, though itâ€™s ridiculously expensive (no economies of scale). Being E Ink, theyâ€™re limited to grayscale but they function very reliably. Iâ€™d look for a used Paperlike Pro or HD on eBay to save on costs.</p>
