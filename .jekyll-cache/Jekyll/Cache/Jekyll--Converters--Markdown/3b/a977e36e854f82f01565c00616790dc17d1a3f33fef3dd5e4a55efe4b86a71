I"€<p>The Onyx Boox Max 2 and Max 3 (mentioned above) both offer HDMI support to use as computer monitors, but reports from buyers trying to use the Max 2 as a computer monitor are <a href="">overwhelming negative</a> due to the input lag. Iâ€™ve used the Max 3 as a monitor and it works fairly well, though. In either case, both make good enough E Ink Android tablets to recommend.</p>
