I"S<p>Onyx is a Chinese computer manufacturer specializing in e-reading devices. Their latest devices feature Android 9.0 with full Google Play support, making them. Their prices are comparable to iPads, with smaller 10” models around ~$500 and the largest 13” models (Boox Max 2 &amp; Boox Max 3) around ~$750-$850. I personally use a Boox Max 3 as a laptop replacement with an external mouse and keyboard; it works fairly well though Android’s tablet support is fairly limited. Still, most Android apps run on them without a hitch, so these devices would likely work well for students.</p>
