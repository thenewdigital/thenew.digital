# Comparing telepresence between reflective and nonreflective display technology

## Abstract
{: .major}

Telepresence, the sense of being present in a virtually-mediated environment, has been established as an important factor of digital technology positively affecting persuasion, recall and recognition, and enjoyment of online activities. Importantly, however, it's also been indicated as a strong risk factor for developing Internet abuse and Video Game Addiction Disorder. The role of certain display characteristics in affecting telepresence has been established by numerous studies, but existing literature has focused exclusively on nonreflective displays. This paper presents the hypothesis that telepresence, the type which leads to technology abuse, is an experience greatly mediated by visual characteristics unique to nonreflective display technology and not reflective display technology. The goal of this paper is to fill a gap in telepresence research by looking for statistically significant differences in experiences of telepresence between comparable nonreflective and reflective displays.

## Introduction
{: .major .numbered}

Telepresence is defined as the feeling of being present in a physically remote or virtually mediated environment [cite]. Coined in 1980 to describe then-hypothetical virtual reality experiences and technologies [cite], it's a term and phenomenon that's since been applied to "traditional" mediums like computer games, television, and even printed novels.

Telepresence is a powerful psychological phenomenon. Stronger experiences of telepresence result in greater website trust [cite], brand perception [cite], impulse buying [cite], , intention to purchase, enjoyment of social media

Certain anecdotes from smartphone users also seem to corroborate the role of telepresence in screen-based technology addictions. Numerous authors, for example, have written about the effectiveness of grayscale display modes to reduce "smartphone addiction" [cite humantech and nytimes]. (Interestingly, smartphone addiction is not a formally recognized disorder like Internet Addiction Disorder and Video Game Addiction Disorder [cite DSM], even though half of American teenagers who own a smartphone feel addicted to it [cite].) While a Google Scholar search of "grayscale telepresence" returned no relevant results, given the existing research of variables like image quality on telepresence [cite], it seems probable that grayscale modes would dramatically affect the phenomenon as well. Through this perspective, these anecdotes may point to an even deeper connection between telepresence and seemingly disparate screen-based technology addictions.

### Display technology categorizations
{: .numbered}

Display technology is often categorized into three primary types based on lighting configuration: "emissive", "transmissive", and "reflective". Emissive displays, including OLED and CRT screens, use light-emitting materials directly to create images. Transmissive displays, including most LCDs (Liquid Crystal Displays), modulate the amount of light emitted from a backlight to create an image. Reflective displays, including certain LCDs and other less popular types of screen technology like electrophoretic displays, rely entirely on reflected ambient light to create their image. For the purpose of this research, the categories "reflective" and "nonreflective" will be used as broader distinctions between reflective displays and all other types.

Much has been written of the impact of display technology on telepresence, but all of that literature has focused specifically on nonreflective displays. Searching for "reflective telepresence" or "nonemissive telepresence" (another term for reflective displays used by some authors [cite]) in Google Scholar returns zero relevant results. This is understandable; reflective display technology available for purchase in consumer electronics is limited almost exclusively to grayscale electrophoretic displays, the type used in the Amazon Kindle and many other e-readers often under the brand name E Ink. The last mass-produced, fully reflective color display known to most consumers was the reflective LCD employed by the GameBoy Advance by Nintendo in 2001[^2]. Since then, to this author's knowledge, there have been very few consumer-grade personal computing devices to ship with a fully reflective color display. This was not for lack of trying; the consumer display industry has unfortunately seen many promising innovations in reflective technology fail to gain traction with device manufacturers over this period. San Diego-based Qualcomm, known to most for their mobile chipsets, spent years working on numerous iterations of a reflective display technology they called Mirasol that ultimately never saw mainstream adoption due to washed-out colors [cite]. Similarly, LiquaVista, a start-up using electrowetting technology to create sunlight-readable color displays, was purchased by Amazon (presumably for use in their popular Kindle line) only to be shut down before coming to market over reports of poor color reproduction and brightness [cite].

Nonreflective screens, however, .

Given the recent associations made between telepresence and technology addictions, however, and the numerous benefits of nonemissive display technology--(often) greatly reduced power consumption, avoidance of subliminally flickering backlights and their anecdotally-reported health consequences[^3], improved sunlight readability, potential benefits to long-term eye health[^4], reduced circadian rhythm disruption--the goal of this study is to look for statistically significant differences in subjective accounts of telepresence between emissive and nonemissive display technology.

### Nonreflective telepresence theory
{: .numbered}

This paper presents and experimentally tests the theory that telepresence, especially as it pertains to technology addiction and enjoyment, is an experience greatly mediated by visual characteristics of nonreflective display technology and not reflective display technology. The high-level explanation for this theory is as follows.

Traditional nonreflective screens, when displaying an image, are unlike most other physical objects humans perceive. The light creating the image (modulated from a backlight via liquid crystal in LCDs or emitted directly via LEDs in OLED displays) has nothing or very little to do with reflected ambient light, which typically only materializes visibly as unwanted glare on the topmost display layer. They're self-illuminating, classified as emissive meaning "light-emitting" by other authors [cite]. This is why, for instance, shadows don't appear on the image from a nonreflective screen, and the image maintains the same brightness and color temperature in a dark room as in direct sunlight (unless software measures like auto-brightness or Apple's True Tone are employed). To humans' mammalian visual processing systems, these visual qualities may more closely resemble a one-way window or "portal" (a term used by some authors to describe telepresence technologies [cite]) to a remote scene than a "moving" photograph of the same scene. The technology, after all, was initially intended for television [cite], an escapist entertainment medium which likely benefits from the illusion. Indeed, from television studies we find evidence that the "window" effect works. Individuals with voyeuristic tendencies, who receive gratification from watching unsuspecting people, tend to seek out television programs focusing on nonfictional portrayals of regular people like reality TV [cite]. Presumably, this correlation is contingent on the viewer believing--at least occassionally--that they are actually watching the subjects of the show through the medium and not just a flipbook-like sequence of photographs displaying those subjects.

Reflective screens, especially ones without built-in front-lights, do not share these visual characteristics. The image, like most objects humans look at [cite], is created as a function of reflected ambient light from the side of the display facing the viewer. As such, its visual appearance more closely resembles paper or a photograph; in fact, even reflective liquid crystal displays are often marketed as "paper-like" [cite]. The brightness of the image is not consistent among different lighting conditions and shadows can appear on the it (in some video demonstrations of reflective displays, presenters intentionally cast a shadow on the display to prove to viewers it's reflective [cite]).

These observations make a clear connection to telepresence, especially as it is often measured through subjective questionnaires. One question used in several telepresence questionnaires comes initially from Kim and Biocca [cite], and asks participants whether the display's image feels more like a place than something they see. Similarly, other questions ask whether participants feel like they're in the room when using the display or if the display is creating its own world. Following the discussion above, this study presents and tests the theory that reflective displays would greatly diminish feelings of telepresence when compared to similar nonreflective displays. Given the correlations already established by other authors between telepresence and various forms of screen-based addictions including anecdotal "smartphone addiction", if the study's findings support this theory it may position reflective display technology as an effective treatment option for many seemingly distinct screen-based technology addictions.

## Method
{: .major .numbered}

This study examined differences in subjective experiences of telepresence by showing participants a video of their own choosing in both reflective and nonreflective screen modes.

### Participants
{: .numbered}

Participants of this study were .

### Display device
{: .numbered}

The Toshiba Portege R500-S5002X netbook was chosen for this study primarily for its transflective LCD screen. Transflective displays -- a combination of "transmissive" and "reflective" technology -- offer a unique opportunity for this research because they can be operated in both transmissive (nonreflective) and reflective modes without affecting other telepresence-related variables like image resolution. In a dimly lit room, the image on this netbook's screen is almost entirely invisible unless the backlight is used, similar to a fully nonreflective display. However, with a bright enough external light illuminating the screen from the front, the panel can be operated without a backlight in fully reflective mode. Conveniently, this netbook allows the backlight to be turned off completely through software, making the transition between modes even simpler for this study.

The testing device was powered by its internal battery during each session. The CloudReady Home Edition operating system provided by Neverware was chosen for its limited software suite and focus on web browsing via the open-source Chromium browser. Participants were given an "incognito" Chromium browser window for their session to ensure privacy and anonymity. The volume of the computer was initially set to its highest available setting via the volume modifier keys on the keyboard; participants were asked only to adjust it if it caused them discomfort and not to change it between sessions, as audio variables have been shown to affect feelings of telepresence [cite].

### Display modes
{: .numbered}

Cool white LED lamps were connected to a 12V DC battery and placed on both sides of the laptop, directed at the screen. These lamps were chosen for their similar color temperature to the cool white LED backlight used in the netbook's display; a DC battery was used to match the DC power supply of the laptop and eliminate potential sources of flicker coming from a switched-mode power supply. The lamps were positioned such that the luminance measured at the base of the laptop was roughly equivalent between both display modes, ___ in nonreflective mode and ___ in reflective mode. Luminance was measured with a ___ meter.

During nonreflective mode, the laptop was set to full brightness using a shell script and the external LED lamps were switched off. Contrast of the screen was lowered to visually match the contrast of the reflective mode (greater glare reduces contrast in most reflective displays). During reflective mode, the laptop brightness was set to 0 (disabling the backlight) via a shell command and the external LED lamps were switched on. The switching of display modes happened automatically halfway into the participant's video via a custom Chrome extension and accompanying webserver linked in the Appendix.

### Viewing environment
{: .numbered}

The laptop and LED lamps were placed on a desk in a room without any windows or overhead lights. The only other light source was a 60-watt incandescent floor lamp in a corner of the room behind the laptop. That light stayed on during both modes. During the session, the door to the room was kept closed to minimize external distraction.

### Content selection
{: .numbered}

Participants were asked to watch a video of their own choosing from YouTube. The duration of the video was required to be between 7-12 minutes. Once participants chose the video and entered full-screen mode, the researcher left the room, closed the door, and waited outside. Participants were asked to alert the researcher when the video was over to receive the questionnaire and debriefing form.

### Telepresence questionnaire
{: .numbered}

The goal of this study was to look for comparative differences in telepresence between nonreflective and reflective display modes. Existing research shows evidence of population differences in subjective accounts of telepresence; for example, men may feel telepresence more frequently than women  [cite]. Furthermore,  telepresence is typically measured not as a binary variable (present in the physical environment vs. present in the virtual environment) but with Likert scales. Therefore, each participant in this study was exposed to both types of display modes, followed by a single telepresence questionnaire adapted by Kim and Biocca [] with response areas for each display mode. The order of display modes--reflective before nonreflective or vice-versa--was randomized for each participant to control for potential impact to telepresence based on the switching of modes itself.
